General syntax:

The syntax is effectively a list of the following constructs:

* Keyword.
* Bounded string.
* Number.
* Comments.

Keywords come from a selection of pre-defined keywords.

Numbers may be signed or unsigned, and they may be a scalar or vector of them, defined by a parenthesized list.

Strings are bounded sequences of characters. Strings can be bounded by the following constructs, each with a different semantic meaning:

* <>: A name used to identify elements defined in the scene graph itself. Stored as IdString
* "": Filenames, or strings that will be assumed to be filenames.
* '': Names of constructs within the graph.
* []: An identifier for a GLSL variable or construct.
* {}: An enumerator. These are defined for specific constructs, and each construct has its own list of valid enums.
