It is often useful to send vertex data for objects on the fly. Immediate mode in OpenGL was the original way to do this, but GL 3.1 core and above removed that.

These classes are a way to have a form of immediate drawing mode that internally
uses buffer objects, but without exposing most of the details to the user.
